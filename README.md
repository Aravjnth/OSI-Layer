Enhanced OSI Network Layer Security

This project focuses on improving OSI Network Layer security by integrating three core filters: Zero-Day Arch, Malware Scanning, and Vulnerability Detection. These filters work together to detect and prevent malicious threats, making the network more resilient to attacks such as zero-day exploits, malware infections, and system vulnerabilities.

Features

Zero-Day Arch Filter: Detects unknown threats using advanced algorithms and machine learning to prevent zero-day attacks.
Malware Scanning Filter: Scans incoming network traffic for known malware patterns using a malware signature database.
Vulnerability Detection Filter: Identifies potential vulnerabilities in the network and alerts the system administrator.
System Architecture

The architecture is designed as a multi-layered security system:

+---------------+        +------------------+        +-------------------+
|    Internet   |  --->  | Zero-Day Arch     | --->  | Malware Scanning   | 
+---------------+        +------------------+        +-------------------+   
                                                        | Vulnerability Detection |  
                                                        +-------------------------+  
                                                                 |    
                                                         +----------------+    
                                                         | Secure Network |  
                                                         +----------------+
